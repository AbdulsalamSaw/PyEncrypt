# PyEncrypt
# This Python script serves as a tool designed to secure a Python file .
When you run the program, it kindly asks you to provide the file's path that you wish to protect. After you've entered the path, the code opens the file and carefully reads its contents.

Next, it takes these contents and puts them into a format that can be securely encrypted using Python's marshal module. 
The encrypted data is then thoughtfully saved in a fresh file, which it names "New_original_file_name," with "original_file_name" being the name of the file you initially provided.

What you get as a result is a brand new file, which is perfectly executable using Python. It contains the encrypted content and acts as a reliable guard for your original file, keeping its content safe from any unauthorized access.

Moreover, the script is considerate and handles situations where the specified file isn't found or when unexpected issues arise during the encryption process, ensuring a smooth experience for you.
